(ns kotoba.component.wit-capability-id-test
  "A capability id reaches this emitter as whatever the host calls an i64, and
  on ClojureScript that is a BigInt.

  `kotoba.component.wit` orders, deduplicates and looks up capability ids, and
  cljs.core cannot do any of those three to a BigInt: `sort-by` answers
  `Cannot compare 6 to 5`, while `distinct` and a map keyed by the id answer
  `Cannot create property closure_uid_… on bigint`, because a primitive cannot
  carry the hash property they attach.

  Nothing had fed it one. `scripts/verify_wit_cljs.cljs` reads
  `lang/wit-vectors.edn` with `cljs.reader`, where an integer token is a
  Number, so the cross-implementation check compared the right WIT with the
  wrong ids and passed. This file is `.cljc` on purpose: the defect is
  invisible from the JVM, where `sort-by`, `distinct` and `get` all handle a
  Long, and a `.clj` test of a `.cljc` emitter tests one host.

  The assertions below are about EQUALITY, not about the absence of a throw:
  the same component emitted with Number ids and with the ids a real compile
  carries must produce the same world, the same digest and the same import
  list. A fix that made the exception go away and changed the bytes would pass
  a `thrown?` test and fail these."
