  each effectful import.

  The host binder in kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang refuses to bind a component
  import through anything weaker than guard-component-ability-call, but until
  this declaration existed it could only assume that requirement rather than
  read it. An assumption cannot be violated and therefore cannot be detected."
