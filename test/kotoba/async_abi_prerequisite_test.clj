  "What the pinned toolchain actually does with WIT `async func`.

   These are not tests of this repository. They pin the three component-model
   facts the bounded-async plan rests on, measured against the pinned
   `wasm-tools` and `.tools/wasmtime`, so that:

   - a later contributor does not spend a day rediscovering why the
     write-the-WAT-by-hand approach cannot work, and
   - a toolchain bump that changes any of these rules fails here, loudly,
     instead of silently changing what the plan is worth.

   The facts, in the order they were measured:

   1. An `async func` import CAN be lowered synchronously -- a plain core
      import, no task/waitable/callback machinery -- but only if the calling
      export is itself `async func`. A synchronous task that blocks traps.
   2. `future<T>` and `stream<T>` are handles in a per-instance table. A
      guest cannot fabricate one; a fabricated index traps.
   3. Fact 2 fails at RUN time, not at build time. The artifact builds and
      validates. That is the dangerous shape: an artifact that looks
      finished.

   What fact 2 does NOT say: that a core module can never create one.
   `wit-component` accepts `[future-new-N]<func>` and the rest of the
   `[future-*]`/`[stream-*]` family as core imports
   (`crates/wit-component/src/validation.rs`, v1.243.0, lines 918-940 for the
   signatures and 2236-2323 for the names). A guest that imports those can
   create futures. What is measured here is only that a guest which does NOT
   import them cannot invent a handle -- which is the mistake worth catching,
   because it is the one that still builds."
