;; CI6 — the WIT layer, under a second implementation.
;;
;; This was the one layer CI6 could not compare at all: kotoba.component.wit
;; was .clj, so ClojureScript could not emit a world from checked KIR. That is
;; now a .cljc namespace, and this recomputes every frozen vector under nbb.
;;
;; What a disagreement would mean: the same checked KIR produced a different
;; WIT world on the two implementations — a different set of imports, a
;; different type mapping, or a different identifier canonicalization. Any of
;; those breaks the claim that a component's world is a property of its KIR
;; rather than of the toolchain that happened to build it.
;;
;; Run from the repository root:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/verify_wit_cljs.cljs

;; The same vectors with the ids a COMPILER carries.
;;
;; Everything above reads its ids out of EDN through `cljs.reader`, where an
;; integer token is a `js/Number`. A capability id does not arrive that way in
;; a real compile: on ClojureScript an i64 is a BigInt, and
;; `kotoba.compiler.frontend/effect-capability-id` produces one. cljs.core can
;; neither `sort-by`, nor `distinct`, nor key a map with a BigInt, so every
;; vector below threw until 2026-09-09 while the check above reported five
;; identical worlds. The vectors were right about the WIT and silent about the
;; ids.
;;
;; This asks for EQUALITY rather than for the absence of a throw: a fix that
;; stopped the exception and changed a digest would pass a try/catch and fail
;; here.
