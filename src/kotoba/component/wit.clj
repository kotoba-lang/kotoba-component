  recursive ADTs that never cross the Canonical ABI (string-encoded EDN
  packages, W4 record-kv) are omitted from WIT and are not rejected here.

  This was not enforced historically. `type-text` renders `[:ref :ns/name]` as
  the bare type name, so a self-referential schema emitted

    record t-n {
      v: s64,
      next: t-n,

  which wasm-tools rejects outright:

    error: type `t-n` depends on itself
      --> next: t-n,

  Emitting WIT that the official tooling refuses is worse than refusing it here:
  the failure surfaces later, in another tool, with no connection to the schema
  that caused it. Reject at the boundary that owns the rule, and name the cycle."
