  "Reading WIT source text.

  Two callers grew their own readers within a day of each other:
  `composition` parsing `wasm-tools component wit` output to see what a
  composed world still imports, and `wasi-contract` parsing vendored `.wit`
  files to see which interfaces a package defines. Both were answering
  questions about the same syntax, and the second one repeated a bug the
  first had already been fixed for.

  So the syntax has one reader. The two shapes it reads are different and
  stay separate functions: printed component WIT nests packages inside
  braces, a vendored `.wit` file declares its package with a semicolon and
  puts interfaces at the top level."

  An interface with no functions cannot convey authority: it is a set of
  type definitions, and a world importing it gains no way to make anything
  happen. This matters because WIT hoists a shared `use`d types interface
  into the world's import list, so the raw import list of every provider
  built here contains `kotoba:application/types` alongside the real ones.
  Excluding it by name would be an exemption; excluding it because it has no
  functions is the actual rule, and it keeps working if a types interface
  ever grows one."
