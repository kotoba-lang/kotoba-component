(ns kotoba.component.wasi-contract
  "Check that the WASI interfaces `component-model-v1.edn` declares actually
  exist in the pinned WASI WIT.

  This namespace exists because the same mistake was made twice, in the same
  file, and both times it survived review. `:clock/now` declared
  `wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.3.0` and `:http/post` declared
  `wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.3.0`; both are 0.2.x names that 0.3.0 removed
  (renamed to `system-clock` and split into `client`/`handler`). Neither was
  wrong in any way a reader could see, because nothing imported them: a
  declaration nobody consumes has no failure mode until the day someone tries
  to use it, and on that day the failure arrives as a toolchain error a long
  way from the line that caused it.

  So the declarations are checked against the vendored WIT instead of against
  a reviewer's memory of a spec that renames things between versions.

  Scope, stated so the check is not read as stronger than it is: this
  resolves the interface NAME inside the pinned package. It does not check
  the function signature, and it does not run `wit-component`. A declaration
  that names a real interface but the wrong function in it still passes here
  and fails at package time."
