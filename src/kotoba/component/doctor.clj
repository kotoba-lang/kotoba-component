  "Toolchain preflight for the component pipeline.

  ## Why this exists

  This repository pins three external binaries. Until now, a machine missing
  them failed in two unhelpful ways:

  - the wrong `wasm-tools` produced 107 identical `wasm-tools version is not
    pinned` errors, one per affected test; and
  - an absent `wasmtime` or `wac` produced raw
    `java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"wasmtime\"` — 82 of them.

  Neither says \"your toolchain is wrong, here is how to fix it\". Worse, the
  suite still reported `0 failures`, because a test that cannot run does not
  fail — it errors, and a reader skimming for failures sees green. On the
  machine that prompted this, roughly three quarters of the component suite's
  assertions were silently not executing (303 of 1148), and the compiler suite
  could not complete at all.

  A preflight turns that into one actionable report.

  ## What it checks, and why the drift check matters most

  The pinned versions are declared in `component-model-v1.edn` — but nothing
  reads them. Enforcement lives in two hardcoded defs in two different
  repositories (`kotoba.wasm.tools/version`, and
  `kotoba.component.composition/wac-version`), and `:minimum-wasmtime-major`
  is enforced nowhere at all. So the contract and the code can disagree
  without anything noticing, and for wasmtime the contract was already
  decorative.

  `contract-drift` compares them. It needs no binaries installed, so it runs
  as an ordinary test."

(def bump-policy
  "When a pinned toolchain version may move.

  This rule already existed, but only as prose inside one variable's docstring
  (`kotoba.component.composition/wac-version`), where it governed a single pin
  and was invisible to anyone looking at the other two. It is stated here
  because the situation it exists for is common and its answer is
  counter-intuitive: an installed version NEWER than the pin is still a
  failure, and the instinctive fix -- advance the pin -- is the wrong one.

  A pin moves only when a newer release directly and verifiably closes a defect
  this codebase reproduced. Not because upstream moved, not to reduce a version
  gap, and not as a routine refresh. These pins exist so artifact bytes are
  reproducible; advancing one without a reason means re-establishing that
  property for no gain, and every release also carries removals that can
  silently change or break emission."
